default GET /:ID
    Implement filter options

bridge GET
    Implement filter options
    maybe allow user to select what fields to view from all possible joined fields
        this might be too much    

'.' might not work for url query functionality because
    I many want to keep it open for searches in the bridge table ex. actor.actor_id
    maybe ':' instead
